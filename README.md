Similar to Favorites, Presets can also be organized into multiple folders that you can name yourself.

Manage all active animations from the "Now Playing" list. You can drag and drop thumbnails to change their layering order on the canvas or remove a specific animation. If you double-click an animation in this list, it becomes selected. The next animation you play from the browser will then replace the selected one instead of being added as a new layer.
